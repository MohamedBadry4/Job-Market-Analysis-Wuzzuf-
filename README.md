# Job-Market-Analysis-Wuzzuf-

In today’s fast-changing job market, understanding what companies need and what job seekers are looking for is critical. This project analyzes real job posting data from Wuzzuf to uncover hiring trends, high-demand skills, and candidate interests.

Using Power BI, I explored key questions for both sides of the job market:

For companies: Which roles, industries, and cities have the highest hiring demand? What experience and salaries are being offered?

For job seekers: Which jobs attract the most attention? How do salary, experience, and location influence candidate interest?

The dashboard features:

Hiring trends over time (time-series analysis)

Top job categories and industries

Salary and experience benchmarking

Talent competition insights (jobs vs candidate interest)

Visualizations for cities, industries, and job categories

By combining data cleaning, visualization, and advanced Power BI features, this project provides actionable insights for HR professionals, recruiters, and job seekers, helping them make data-driven decisions in the Egyptian job market.
